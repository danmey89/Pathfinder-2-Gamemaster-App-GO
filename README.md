Pathroller is intended to help you run your Pathfinder2 game.  
As a gamemaster you can organize all your player's characters,  
and NPCs in one place.  
You can make rolls for single or multiple characters, which is  
especially helpful for secret group rolls. Additionally Pathroller  
offers an initiative tracker with round counter.  

The app accepts characters in JSON format and is intended for  
characters exported by Pathbuilder. The docs directory contains  
two test files that should be replaced by your own files.

Commands:

To initialize the database, call the app with flag:  

-createDB true

To load the database with JSON files call the app with:

-saveData true


Pathroller is still in development.
